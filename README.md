# Notecil
Notecil (pronounced like "note" and "pencil" smashed together, because I'm not creative) is a cross-platform note-taking app designed for stylus'.
## Installation
The first step is to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Ensure it is configured in your PATH correctly by writing the command:
    npm --version
If npm could not be found, you will need to manually add NodeJS to your path (try restarting first before you fiddle with your PATH!).
Next, clone the repo:
    git clone https://github.com/andriyDev/Notecil.git
Go into that directory:
	cd Notecil
Finally, run this:
    npm install
Once the installation is finished, to start the app you can run:
    npm start
